# RP2040_Macropad_3x3
RP2040_Macropad_3x3 is a compact macropad project designed as a customizable USB input device for productivity and control tasks. It provides a 3×3 key layout combined with three rotary encoders and an integrated display, allowing users to trigger shortcuts, control values, and receive visual feedback in real time. The device is intended for use cases such as workflow automation, media control, creative software, or development environments. Overall, the project serves as a flexible platform for building a dedicated control pad tailored to specific user needs.

# :floppy_disk: Firmware
The RP2040_Macropad_3x3 uses [**QMK firmware**](https://github.com/qmk) as its dedicated software platform, allowing full customization of keys, rotary encoders, and the integrated display. This enables users to configure the macropad for shortcuts, macros, and workflow-specific controls.
